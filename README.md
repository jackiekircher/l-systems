# l-systems n'at

this is just a playful little project that I started to experiment with
l-systems. its current iteration uses a static start and set of
production rules, but randomizes the drawing rules. I deliberately made
the production rules explicitly tree-like, but I think the random angles
of the branches make for some really interesting drawings.

## setup

1. [download Processing](https://www.processing.org/download/)
2. fork this repository
3. open the l_system folder with the Processing runtime and hit play

###controls

* **click and drag:** rotate the system
* **c:** reset the camera
* **s:** take a screen shot
* **r:** replay the current system
* **space:** create a new system with random angles

## demo

alternatively, if you'd like to just see a live demo, I have it running
up on [my site](http://jackiekircher.com/projects/l-systems)

## thank you

this project is built almost entirely upon Jose Sanchez's (@jomasan) [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF8LGLVrwfo). I may have refactored just about everything and added a few elements of my own but I wouldn't have known where to start without you. thank you Jose!
